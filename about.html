                <h1>Our Story</h1>
                <p class="bg-pampas">
                    We're an Indonesian chocolatier with a rich history. Our founder, Richard Carmon
                    Purdy, started
                    selling
                    homemade chocolates in 1907. After 100+ years of crafting fine chocolates, you get to know a thing
                    or
                    two about doing it right.
                    <br /><br />
                    At Schokolade, everyone—from our chocolatiers to our in-shop chocolate
                    connoisseurs—is always inspired to take you away from the ordinary.
                    <br /><br />
                    We source premium-quality ingredients from around the world, and choose local options whenever
                    possible. We never compromise
                    on
                    quality, and you bet you can taste it.
                    <br /><br />
                    Our chocolates are made with sustainable cocoa. We
                    pay a
                    premium
                    for sustainable cocoa to ensure our farmer partners and co-ops are supported by programs that
                    improve
                    their profit and the livelihoods of their families. It's really quite simple, it's a choice we've
                    made
                    because it's the right choice to make.

                    This principle drives all of the decision making across our company and leads us to look for
                    sourcing partners who operate the same way as us. We are so proud to partner with companies like
                    Mountain Rose Herbs who offer organic and fair-trade ingredients.
                    <br /><br />
